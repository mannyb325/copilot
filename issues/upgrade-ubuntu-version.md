# Upgrade Ubuntu version across the project to the latest release

We need to upgrade the Ubuntu version used throughout the repository (CI/CD, development environments, documentation, etc.) to the latest available release. This ensures access to new features, improved security, and better support.

**Tasks:**
- Audit current Ubuntu usage and version(s)
- Identify necessary changes to dependencies and scripts
- Update CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions runners)
- Update documentation and setup instructions
- Test the upgrade thoroughly

Sub-issues can be created for each major task.
